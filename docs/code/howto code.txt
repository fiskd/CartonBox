So far:

	*No spaces please! use tabs! (configure your IDE, eclipse, netbeans or whatever you are going to use).
	*No egyptian braces.
	*Comment properly when possible.
	*My MVC implementation is not the best but I'm trying to keep some standards here, help me out if you can.

and that should be about it for now.
