The Changelog

I'm bad at making changelogs, I often forgot most of what I do since the last
release, but there you go:

0.4
# second release
- downloads of anything (posts, tags, images) are now concurrent ant won't
  keep on waiting

0.2
# initial (accidental) release
- so far:
	- engines
		- danbooru 2.x
		- danbooru 1.18.x
		both supporting posts, tags, searching and danbooru2 authentication
	- supported sites
		- danbooru
		- hijiribe (danbooru mirror)
		- yande.re
		- behoini (3DBooru)
	- preferences are not complete, some options are broken and a couple ones
	don't really work (eg blacklists)
	- image loading and caching (external and internal cache)
